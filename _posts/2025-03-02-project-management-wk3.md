## Scope Management

Scope: the definition and description of the end result or mission of project in specific, tangible and measurable terms. It claries the <b>expectations of the stakeholders</b>.

Scope management consists of a series of planning, organising and monitoring/controlling activities

## Why manage scope?

A project's scope defines the boundaries of the project and provide the basis for all subsequent steps in project planning and execution cycles.

Scope management: process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project scope will be defined, validated and controlled.

### SMART objectives

### Deliverables
Define expected outputs over the life of the project. (Tangible, verifiable products)


## Agile

Escient guest speaker: Jen Dolden, Victor de Blecourt

### Case study healthcare.gov

health insurance marketplace supporting Obama's medicare roll-out which launched 2013.

Register -> Verify -> Shop -> Determine subsidy -> Enroll

Dev cost: $840 mil USD
55 contract firms involved
4 million unique visitors, only 6 enrolled
1% was able to enroll in 1st week
many security issues, confusing
site was taken down after 1 week

### healthsherpa.com

Start up website initially focused on core scope only, allowed users to compare different plans and purchase
to go directly on their website,

3 team members
released after 1 month, helped more than million people.

This was way more successful and executed way better.

### Why did it fail

Waterfall approach
too many stakeholders outsource partners
tried to do everything at once
not enough testing
big-bang release
no clear leadership
lack of end to end operational view of critical path

### What is agile?

Iterative approach delivering project, that priorities delivering value and continuous improvement.

It's also a mindset, way of working, based on a set of values and principals

delivering customer value early and often
cross-functional collaboartion
continuous improvement

### History

Originated in software dev, and its values and principals were summarised in Agile Manifesto in 2001

Reaction to the waterfall approach that missed the adaptability to keep up with the speed of change in software dev.

Is now also used outside of IT, became a way of working in many divisions in organisations.

### Values

4 values and 12 principles support the agile delivery practices

Left > Right

### Principles

### Common frameworks

#### Kanban

focused on real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work,
work items are represented visually allowing team to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

#### Scrum

cross-functional teams come together and create backlog and work in sprints, self-organise while working towards a goal,
and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

#### SAFe

Scaled Agile Framework is a set of organisation and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises in scaling agile
practices.

(Need training to work with this)

### Waterfall

project focus with a sequence of development phases, resulting a final product at the end

but agile has a product focus with short iterations, resulting in regular deployment and improvement, and working
outcomes at the end of each sprints

### Estimates & Planning

Your plans will get much better as it goes, so plan often and adjust.

![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.32.58 PM.png](../assets/img/screenshots/32541/wk3/Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%205.32.58%E2%80%AFPM.png)

### Agile @SpaceX

Nasa's launch cost for a rocket is $2 Billion

SpaceX's launch cost is currently $30 Million and reusable.

It welcome changes -> Rapid iterative design

Deliver value frequently -> Design software integrated with hardware printers, one Raptor engine a day for testing now

Reflect and adjust -> Use test flights to fail fast

Technical excellence & maintain simplicity -> Minimise waste by re-using rockets, Continuous simplify the raptor engine

### Successful Agile in action

#### Project Charter

![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.41.57 PM.png](../assets/img/screenshots/32541/wk3/Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%205.41.57%E2%80%AFPM.png)

#### Project Backlog

Create activities, capture the value you plan to deliver, break the work down

Back log of logs, now priorities it 

![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.43.10 PM.png](../assets/img/screenshots/32541/wk3/Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%205.43.10%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Higher the backlog soon it needs to be included in sprints, more detailed, smaller and ready the User stories are. 

#### Work Breakdown Structure

SAFe example 
![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.44.01 PM.png](../assets/img/screenshots/32541/wk3/Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%205.44.01%E2%80%AFPM.png)

User story hierarchy helps teams organise their work into smaller batches of work.

No definitive user story hierarchy, every org's interpretation is slightly different

#### MVP 

first version of product, with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can provide feedback for future product development

#### User story map 

Great way of communicating with stakeholders
Ex) Outlook

#### Use scrum to deliver in sprints

![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.48.53 PM.png](../assets/img/screenshots/32541/wk3/Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%205.48.53%E2%80%AFPM.png)

#### Planning horizons & feedback cycles

![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.51.37 PM.png](../assets/img/screenshots/32541/wk3/Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%205.51.37%E2%80%AFPM.png)

### when agile? when waterfall?
