need to tackle now 

### Semi-quantitative analysis 

uses numbers to label categories instead of words

level of risk determined by a math function rather than a matrix

use numbers to determine risk priorities, not values

more categories can be generated without the need to be creative and come up with new labels.

process is carried out throughout the project.
