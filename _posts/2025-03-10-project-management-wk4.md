## Work Breakdown Structure

Broken down into achievable tasks

Tasks can be broken into subtasks

All tasks must add up to its parent subtask

A task that has subtasks, must have more than 1 and must be labelled correctly.

Subtasks at the lowest levels are called work-packages. (if task have no subtasks, that task is considered a work-package.)
