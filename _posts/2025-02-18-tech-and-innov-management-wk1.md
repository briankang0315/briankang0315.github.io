## Creative Thinking

Top 10 idea-friendly time: "while at work isn't there!"

## Divergent & Convergent Thinking

### Divergent
- coming up with new ideas (making list)

### Convergent
- choosing one and implementing (making choices)

Organisations over utilise convergent and under utilise divergent thinking
(boss saying it won't work to an employee with a new idea)

Fear of failure often discourages divergent thinking
