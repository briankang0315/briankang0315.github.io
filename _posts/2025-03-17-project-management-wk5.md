we can't say for certain what will happen. there are many other factors. to just simply determine how the triangle would
change.

## Time management

Many managers cite delivering projects on time as a major challenge.

Time has very little flexibility.

1. Define activities (planning)
2. Sequence activies (planning)
3. estimate duration (planning)
4. develop schedule  (planning)
5. monitor and control schedule
